# üß† Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) System

This project is a full-stack Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) application designed to **capture, process, and visualize brain signals** in real time. It enables communication between a user's brain and a computer system using EEG data and AI/ML techniques. The backend handles signal acquisition, preprocessing, and classification, while the frontend provides a responsive interface to display results.

### Backend:
- Python 3.x
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Frontend:
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun (any package manager)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### üß† Backend (API Server)

1. **Clone the repository**  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/umertariq22/BCI-Backend.git
    cd BCI-Backend
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the backend server**  
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    - Replace `main:app` if your app entry point is different.
    - Example with host/port:
      ```bash
      uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
      ```

### üíª Frontend (User Interface)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**  
    ```bash
    cd frontend  # or the correct frontend path
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
    ```bash
    npm install      # or yarn / pnpm / bun install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**  
    ```bash
    npm run dev      # or yarn dev / pnpm dev / bun dev
    ```

4. **Visit the app**  
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
